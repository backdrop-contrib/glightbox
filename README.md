Glightbox
=========

Glightbox is a javascript lightbox plugin. It is responsive, has the ability to
display multiple images in a slideshow-like gallery. Image captions consist
of title and description and can be placed either at the bottom, top, left or
right side of the lightbox. The position can be set globally in configuration
page or controlled by a text field for each node individually.

The module provides an image field Glightbox formatter and access to most of
the plugin's settings.
